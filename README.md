**HEART DISEASE PREDICTION**

I prepared a heart disease prediction system to predict whether the patient is likely to be diagnosed
with a heart disease or not using the medical history of the patient. 
We used different algorithms of machine learning such as Logistic regression and KNN to predict and classify the patient with heart disease.
A quite Helpful approach was used to regulate how the model can be used to improve the accuracy of prediction of Heart Attack in any individual.
